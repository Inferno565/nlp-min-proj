# Legal Text Classification using Natural Language Processing  

## Project Overview  
This project is part of the **Natural Language Processing (NLP) course** for **Semester 6** students at **Pillai College of Engineering**. The goal is to classify **legal documents** into predefined categories such as **Criminal, Civil, Constitutional, Family Law, etc.** using **Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Language Models**.  

The project covers essential NLP techniques such as **text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation** to determine the most effective approach for **legal text classification**.

## Project Title  
**Education Online Course Categorization Using Natural Language Processing** 

## Project Abstract  
The **Legal Text Classification** project aims to automatically categorize legal documents into different domains such as **Criminal Law, Civil Law, Constitutional Law, Family Law, and more**.  

Various **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Transformer-based Language Models** are explored to **accurately classify legal text based on its content**. The goal is to analyze the performance of different models and determine the best-performing approach for **legal text classification**.

## Conclusion  
This **Legal Text Classification** project demonstrates the power of **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Transformer-based models** for **automating legal text classification**.  

The comparative analysis shows that **BERT outperforms traditional ML and deep learning models**, achieving the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. By experimenting with different algorithms, we gain valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses, helping us identify the best approach for **legal document classification**.
