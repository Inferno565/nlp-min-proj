Desai, C. Krishna Reddi, T. Ramachandra Rao and M. section K. Sastri, for the appellants.\\nSadashiv Rao, J. B. Dadachanji and section N. Andley, for the respondent.\\nMarch 28.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO, J.\\nThis is an appeal on a certificate granted by the former High Court of Hyderabad.\\nA suit was brought by the respondent in 1920 with respect to village Timmapet.\\nThe case of the respondent was that the village had been granted to his ancestor Harinarayan alias Raja Nemiwant Bahadur by the Nizam in 1787.\\nOn the death of Raja Harinarayan, the village was conferred by another sanad on his son Raja Govind Narayan in 1811.\\nEver since then the village had continued in the possession of the descendants of Raja Govind Narayan.\\nIn 1817, Raja Govind Narayan granted this village on Tahud (i.e., lease) to Raja Rama Krishna Rao, ancestor of the defendants.\\nInam inquiries with respect to this village started in 1901 and then an objection was made on behalf of the appellants that the village had been granted to their ancestors by the Nizam and the respondent was only entitled to the pan mukta of the village and no more.\\nPan mukta means a fixed sum which is payable in perpetuity for any land granted by the Ruler or the jagirdar to any person.\\nThe respondent 's case further was that the lease money was being regularly paid, though some time before the suit there was some default.\\nThe respondent had to file a suit to recover the lease money which was decreed and the decretal amount was recovered.\\nIn 1917 disputes arose between the parties and consequently in 1918 the respondent asked the appellants to vacate the village.\\nThey, however, refused to do so.\\nThereupon the present suit was filed in 1920 and the respondent 's case was that the lease granted to the appellants was not a permanent lease and could only enure for the lifetime of the grantor and therefore the respondent was entitled to possession of the 620 village, particularly as the appellants had begun to assert a title adverse to the respondent.\\nThe suit was resisted by the appellants, and their main defence was that the village had been granted as bilmakta with a fixed pan makta in their favour by the Nizam and therefore the respondent was only entitled to the fixed pan makta per year and could not claim to dispossess them from the village.\\nAs an alternative, defence of limitation was also pleaded, though the written statement did not make it clear whether the bar of limitation was under article 142 or article 144 of the Limitation Act.\\nThere were other defenses also with which we are however not concerned in the present appeal.\\nThe trial court framed a large number of issues, which were answered in favour of the respondent and the suit was decreed and the plaintiff was held entitled to obtain possession of the village as well as to recover mesne profits at the rate of Rs. 931 12 0 0.\\nsection per year.\\nOn the two main defenses, the trial court held that the village had not been granted by the Nizam to the appellants as claimed by them and the appellants were liable to ejectment as they could not claim the rights of a permanent losses under the lease granted to their ancestor by the respondent 's ances tor.\\nFurther on the question of limitation, the trial court held that the suit was not barred by article 142.\\nIt does not appear that the case of adverse possession was put forward in the trial court.\\nThere were two appeals to the High Court; one of them was by the appellants and the other by the respondent.\\nThe respondent 's appeal was confined only to the rate of mesne profits while the appellants reiterated their two main contentions as to the nature of their right and limitation.\\nThe appeals were heard by a Division Bench of the High Court, the Judges composing Which however differed.\\nSchri Ran, J., agreed with the trial court as to the nature of the rights of the 'respondent as well as on the question of limitation and was of the opinion that the appeal of the appellants should be dismissed.\\nIt appears that in the High Court a plea 621 of adverse possession was also raised in the matter of limitation; but that plea was also negatived by Schripat Rau, J. Further Schripat Rau, J., was of the View that the appeal of the respondent should be allowed and the amount of mesne profits per year should be _ raised to Rs. 4,381 12 11.\\nThe other learned Judge, Khalilulzaman Siddiqu, J., seems Lo have held in favour of the appellants both on the questions of title and adverse possession and was of the view that the suit should be dismissed in toto.\\nThere was then a reference to a third learned Judge, Ansari, J. He agreed with Schripat Rau, J., on the questions of title and limitation; but as by the time he came to deliver judgment the Hyderabad (Abolition of Jagirs) Regulation, No. LXIX of 1358 F had come into force from 1951 and possession could not be granted to the respondent, Ansari, J., held that the respondent would be entitled to the compensation payable on the abolition of jagirs.\\nAs Ansari, J., had per force to differ from Schripat Rau, J., as to the part of the relief to be granted to the respondent because of the abolition of jagirs, the case was referred to a Full Bench of three Judges in view of section 8 of the Hyderabad High Court Act.\\nThe Full Bench held that as Ansari and Schripat Rau, JJ., were in agreement on the questions of title and limitation these matters did riot fall to be decided before them and would be concluded by the judgment of Ansari, J.\\nBut on the nature of relief on which Ansari, J., per force had to differ from the view of Schripat Rau, J., the Full Bench upheld the view of Ansari, J. Thereafter the appellants applied for a certificate for leave to appeal to this Court, which was granted; and that is how the matter has come up before us.\\nLearned counsel for the appellants has urged only two points before us.\\nIn the first place, lie submits that on the evidence it has been proved that the Nizam granted a bilmakta sanad to the appellants which included this village also and therefore the appellants were entitled to the possession of the village permanently subject only to the payment of pan 622 makta to the respondent.\\nIn the second place, he submits that even if it be held that the Nizam did not grant a bilmakta sanad including this village, the appellants had perfected their title by adverse possession to the limited right of being permanent lessees under the respondent subject to payment of a fixed amount of rent per year.\\nThe first question therefore that arises is whether the appellants ' case that this village is included in the bilmakta sanad granted to them by the Nizam and therefore by virtue of that sanad they are entitled to hold this village permanently subject only to the payment of a certain sum annually to the respondent, is proved.\\nIt is now no longer in dispute that the village was granted in jagir to the ancestors of the respondent.\\nIt is also not in dispute that in 1817 Raja Govind Narayan granted a kowl in favour of the appellants ' ancestor.\\nUnder the terms of that kowl the village was granted on Tahud (lease) for the fixed sum of Rs. 1027 10 0 per year to the appellants ' ancestor.\\nNo term is mentioned in the kowl as to its duration; but after reciting that the village had been granted on Tahud for a certain fixed amount annually, the kowl goes on to say that the grantee should with entire confidence rehabilitate old and new riots and pay the amount of Tabud annually as per fixed installments, in every crop season.\\nAs one reads the kowl, on its plain terms it cannot be read to confer on the appellants ' ancestor a permanent lease on a fixed sum which was not liable to be varied at all.\\nBut the appellants claim that they had been in uninterrupted possession since 1817 for over 100 years.\\non the same rent when the suit was filed and this shows that the village must have been granted to them as a permanent lease.\\nWe cannot accept this contention and the fact that the appellants and their ancestors have continued in possession over 100 years on the same rent would not make the kowl of 1817 a permanent, lease in the face of its plain terms.\\nThe courts below were therefore right in the view that the kowl does not show a grant of a permanent lease on a fixed annual payment to the appellants.\\n623 The appellants however relied on what happened soon after the kowl was granted to them.\\nIt appears that soon after 1817 the appellants ' ancestor made a vajab ul arz (i.e., application to the Nizam) with various prayers.\\nOne of the prayers was for grant of bilmakta sanad.\\nThis was obviously with respect to certain Government lands, which the ancestors of the appellants held.\\nIn para 6 of the vajab ul arz it is said that \\\"in these days your devotee has regularly paid Government dues and expects that he should receive sanads of bilmakta with the seal of Diwani\\\".\\nIn para 3 it is said that \\\"from out of the Government Talukas whichever is entrusted on Tahud, your petitioner will pay the Tahud amount and will look after and improve the Taluka\\\".\\nOn a fair reading of the vajabul arz there can be little doubt that the ancestor of the appellants was praying that he should be granted a bilmakta sanad of lands held by him from the Government.\\nTo this vajab ul arz was appended a list of villages which apparently the ancestor of the appellants hold.\\nThis list contained 88 villages.\\nThere is no difficulty about 85 of these villages which were apparently field by the ancestor of the appellants from the Government; but about three villages there was a special mention in the list.\\nThese were:(1) Timmapet, Jagir Raja Nemivant, Makta of Zamindar of Sugur.\\nIt may be mentioned that the ancestor of the appellants was the Zamindar of Sugur and that is how he prayed for a sanad of bilmakta; (2) the village Korotkal, attached to Jagir Bahrami, makta Zamindar Sugur; and (3) Palmur, including hamlet Gattalpalli.\\nThese three villages were obviously not of the same kind as the other 85 villages.\\nVillage Timmapet was in the jagir of the ancestor of the respondent and Could not therefore ordinarily be granted to the ancestor of the appellants.\\nVillage Korotkal was an attached jagir which has handed over to one Bakhshi Ismail Khan while village Palmur had been granted to the ancestor of the appellants.\\nVillage himself in lieu of seri.\\nStrictly speaking these three villages which stood apart should not have been included in the list of villages for which bilmakta 624 sanad was prayed for.\\nAnyhow the order of the Government on this vajab ul arz was that a sanad with seal of Niabat Diwani be granted.\\nThe actual sanad which was granted by virtue of this order has not been strictly proved, though a copy of it appears in a judgment copy of which has been filed.\\nWe do not therefore propose to refer to this copy.\\nIt appears however that in 1880 a bilmkta sanad was again granted by the Nizam himself to the ancestor of the appellants on the death of the previous holder.\\nThe amount of bilmakta (i.e., fixed annual payment) was fixed at Rs. 1,05,412.\\nThis amount is made up of the revenue of 85 villages out of the 88 villages which were included in the list along with the vajab ul arz.\\nThe remaining three villages which we have mentioned above, were also shown in the schedule to this sanad under the heading \\\"Deduct 3 villages of separate Jagir\\\".\\nThe three villages under this heading are Timmapet, Korotkal and Palmur.\\nIt is the meaning of these words under the heading of which these villages appear which; required interpretation in the present suit.\\nThe contention of the respondent was that the heading showed that the bilmakta sanad granted by the Nizam excluded these villages, for the revenue of these villages amounting to Rs. 2,101 was not included in the bilmakta amount of Rs. 1,05,412.\\nIt is further contended on behalf of the respondent that the, reason why these three villages were mentioned in this manner in the schedule attached to the bilmakta sanad was that the appellants ' ancestor had wrongly included these ' villages in his list filed with the vajab ul arz and ever, since then these villages were included in the schedule to the sanads but were always shown as deducted from the bilmakta.\\nWe are of opinion that this contention of the respondent is correct and the courts below were right in accepting the respondent 's contention in this behalf.\\nThe very fact that the revenue of these villages is not included in the bilmakta amount of Rs. 1,05,412 shows that they could not be part of the bilmakta grant by the Nizam.\\nWe cannot accept the argument on behalf of the appellants that the revenue of these villages was 625 not included because the ancestor of the appellants had to pay the amount of this revenue in the case of Timmapet and Korotkal to the jagirdars and the revenue of Palmur was given to him free in seri.\\nThe very fact that these three villages appear under the heading \\\" 'deduct three villages of separate jagir\\\" along with the fact that their revenue is not included in the bilmakta grant of Rs. 1,05,412 shows that they were not part of the bilmakta sanad.\\nIt is true that they have been mentioned in the schedule, and strictly speaking they should not have been so mentioned there; but the reason for that in our opinion is that the appellants ' ancestor had included them in his list and they seem to have been put down in the schedule to the sanad from that list.\\nBut the way in which they were put in the schedule to the sanad shows that they were not part of the sanad granted by the Nizam.\\nOur attention was also drawn to the Avarja said to have been prepared in 1836 in which also these three villages are included.\\nBut Avarja is merely a paper in which a note of the sanads issued each day is mentioned.\\nThe fact therefore that these; three villages were mentioned in the Avarja can be easily explained by the fact that they were mentioned in the sanads which were prepared from the list of villages supplied by the appellants ' ancestor along with his vajab ul arz.\\nThe presence of these three villages in the Avarja would not establish that the villages were granted as bilmakta by the Nizam to the appellants ' ancestor, unless the sanads granted by the Nizam establish it.\\nWe have already examined the sanad of 1880 which is on the record and have no difficulty in agreeing with the courts below that the bilmakta sanad excluded these villages and was only confined to the remaining villages for which the appellants ' ancestor paid Rs. 1,05,412 to the Nizam as the fixed annual amount.\\nIt was urged on behalf of the appellants that the Nizam was an absolute Ruler and it Was open to him to take away any land from a jagirdar and grant it to any other person.\\nThat is undoubtedly so; but even where an absolute Ruler takes away some land from 79 626 a jagirdar and gives it to another person, it seems to us clear that he would inform the jagirdar that he had taken away in whole or in part what he had granted to him and would also make it clear by proper words in the sanad granted to the other person that he was giving him the land taken away from the jagirdar.\\nIn any case where the land was granted earlier to the jagirdar, there must be a clear indication in the sanad to another person that what had been granted to the jagirdar had been taken away and was being granted to this other person.\\nAs we read the sanad of 1880 we find no clear indication in it that the village of Timmapet which was granted along with other villages as jagir to the respondent 's ancestor was being taken away at any rate in part and that in future the respondent 's ancestor would only be entitled to a fixed sum from the appellants ' ancestor with respect to this village and no more.\\nOn the other hand, in the recital of the sanad unfortunately there is nothing clear for the words \\\"etc.\\n\\\" appear therein in more than one place as to the land granted.\\nWe have therefore to turn to the schedule for whatever help we can get from it.\\nThe schedule shows that these three villages were under the heading \\\"deduct three villages of separate jagir\\\".\\nFrom that the only inference can be that these three villages were not being included in the bilmakta sanad.\\nIn any case we cannot infer from that the Nizam was intending to take away a part of the rights of the respondent 's ancestor in village Timmapet and confer them on the appellants ' ancestor.\\nFurther there is nothing to show that the respondent 's ancestors were ever informed that the Nizam had taken away part of their rights in village Timmapet.\\nIf anything, as late as 1918 village Timmapet along with others was conferred perpetually in favour of the respondent as zat jagir subject to the payment of 2 per centum of haq malkana.\\nAt that time the appellants ' ancestor had raised some dispute about his right as bilmaktadar of Timmapet but that was left undecided.\\nOn a review therefore of the evidence in this case the conclusion is inescapable that the appellants ' ancestor was never granted bilmakata sanad by the Nizam which 627 included the village of Timmapet.\\nTheir rights in this village therefore depend entirely on the kowl of 1817, which, as we have already pointed out, did not confer a permanent lease.\\nThe case of the appellants therefore based on their title on the sanads granted to them by the Nizam must fail.\\nWe now turn to the question of limitation.\\nThe case put forward before us in that connection is that the appellants have prescribed for the limited right of being permanent lessees of this land by adverse possession and the genesis of this is traced to what happened in 1875.\\nIt appears that there was trouble between the then ancestors of the parties about this village about that time.\\nThe ancestor of the respondent appears to have made an application to the Government and the Revenue Member had issued orders for delivery of possession of this village to him.\\nThereupon the ancestor of the appellants made a representation to the Prime Minister against that order in which it was said that the ancestor of the respondent had conferred the said village on the ancestor of the appellants by way of bilmakta (i.e., on a fixed amount) more than eighty years ago and the ancestor of the appellants had been in possession all along and had been regularly paying the amount due; the ancestor of the appellants therefore prayed that the order of delivery of possession of the land to the respondent 's ancestor be set aside.\\nIt is remarkable that in this representation the case put forward was that the village had been granted bilmakta,by the ancestor of the respondent to the appellants ' ancestor and not by the Nizam or the Government to the appellants ' ancestor.\\nHowever that may be, the Prime Minister ordered that as the ancestor of the appellants had been in possession for a long time, no order could be passed dispossessing him.\\nThe ancestor of the res pondent then tried to get this order of the Prime Minister changed but failed and in consequence the appellants ' ancestor remained in possession thereof.\\nIt is urged that this shows that the ancestor of the appellants asserted that he was entitled to possession as a permanent lessee against the respondent 's ancestor and this claim was resisted by the respondents 628 ancestor and the resistance failed.\\nTherefore it must be held that adverse possession of this limited kind was asserted to the knowledge of the respondent 's ancestor and in consequence twelve years after 1875 the adverse title would be perfected and article 144 would bar the present suit for ejectment.\\nThere is no doubt that there can be adverse possession of a limited interest in property as well as of the full title as owner: see Sankaran vs Periasami(1); Thakore Fatehsingji Dipsangji vs Bamanji Ardeshir Dalal (2); and Shrimat Daivasikhamani Ponnambala Desikar vs Periayanan Chetti (9).\\nThe present however is a case where the original kowl was granted by a jagirdar and the question arises whether in the case of a jagir there can be adverse possession of a limited interest in the nature of a permanent lease.\\nIn that connection one has to look to the incidents of a jagir, and the first incident of a jagir is that it must be taken Prima facie as an estate granted, for life: Gulabdas Jugjivandas vs The Collector of Surat.\\n(4) In the present.\\ncase also the indication is that the jagir that was granted to Raja Harinarayan in 1787, was for life, for we find that on the death of Raja Harinarayan a fresh sanad was granted to his son Raja Govind Narayan in 181 1.\\nSimilar conclusion can be drawn from the fact that as late as 1880 a bilmakta sanad was granted to Raja Rameshwar Rao, an ancestor of the appellants on the death of his father in spite of certain sanads in favour of previous holders of bilmakta.\\nBut the appellants contend that after 1811 no fresh sanads were granted to the descendants of Raja Govind Narayan and therefore it must be held that the jagir became hereditary and was not merely for the lifetime of the grantee after Raja Govind Narayan 's death.\\nThere is no doubt that there are no sanads on the record which might have been granted to the descendants of Raja Govind Narayan; but there is equally no evidence on behalf of the appellants that no such sanads were in fact granted to the descendants of Raja Govind Nara yan, due to change in State Policy.\\nReliance has been (1) Mad. 467.\\n(2) Bom.\\n(3) (1936) L.R. 63 I.A. Mad.\\n(4) (1878) L.R. 6 1.A. 54.\\n629 placed on behalf of the appellants on a publication of the Government of Hyderabad called \\\"Jagir Administration\\\", Vol.\\nI, at P. 3, where the following passage appears. \\\"Zaot or personal grants were originally tenable for lifetime only.\\nIf, however, the Sanad conferring such grant contains any words indicative of permanency the grant was treated as one in perpetuity.\\nFormerly on the death of the grantee, the Jagir was attached and re issued in favour of his eldest son by another Sanad.\\n\\\" It is urged on the basis of this that the system of attachment of jagir and reissue of new sanads in favour of the eldest son fell into disuse in Hyderabad and therefore jagirs became hereditary.\\nIn the first place this passage does not show when the system of attachment of jagir and re issue of another sanad came to an end.\\nIn the second place, even this passage shows that jagirs were tenable only for life unless there was something in the terms of jagir grant to show that it was perpetual.\\nThe jagir grant of Raja Govind Narayan is on the record and there is nothing in it to show that it was granted perpetually, Therefore, it must be held to be a grant for life time only; at any rate it is clear that the system of granting sanads on each succession was certainly in force when Raja Govind Narayan succeeded, for he was granted a fresh sanad.\\nIn his case it must therefore be held that the jagir was granted to him only for life.\\nReliance was also placed on Raje Vinaykrao Nemiwant Brahmin vs Raje Shriniwasrao Nemiwant Brahmin (1) where a letter of 1877 from the Government of India, Foreign Department,, is quoted as saying that \\\"The Governor General in Council also accepts the view that these inams are held in accordance with the custom of the Hyderabad State, which permits the continuance of such jagheers to posterity, notwithstanding the absence of specific provision on the point, but at the same time reserves to the State the right of resuming such grants at pleasure.\\n\\\" (1) I.L.R. 630 But even this letter shows that the State has got the right to resume the grant at pleasure and if that is so it cannot be said that the jagirs granted in Hyderabad were permanent and hereditary, though it may be that a son was allowed to succeed to \\\" 'the father in the normal course.\\nThe State however had always the right to resume the grant at pleasure.\\nThe nature of jagirs in Hyderabad came to be considered by a bench of five judges of the former High Court of Hyderabad in Ahmad un Nissa Begum vs State ( ').\\nAnsari, J., after referring to two cases of the Privy Council of the former State of Hyderabad as it was before 1947 and certain firmans of the Ruler observed as follows as to the nature of jagirs in Hyderabad: \\\"The cumulative effect of the authorities referred to above is that the jagir tenures in this State consisted of usufructuary rights in lands which were terminable on the death of each grantee, were inalienable during his life, the heirs of the deceased holder got the estate as fresh grantees and the right to confer the estate was vested in the Ruler and exercisable in his absolute discretion.\\nNevertheless, the Jagirdars had during their lives valuable rights of managing their estates, enjoying the usufructs and other important privileges which conferred considerable monetary benefits on them.\\\" This view of Ansari, J., as to the nature of jagirdari tenure was accepted by the other learned Judges composing the Bench.\\nTherefore the mere fact that sanads granted to the successors of Raja Govind Narayan have not been produced in this case or even the fact that no such sanads were granted lo them would make no difference to the nature of the jagirdari tenure in Hyderabad.\\nIt is only in 1918 for the first time that we know that this village along with other villages was conferred in perpetuity on the respon dent.\\nThere is nothing to show that before that the respondent 's ancestors had permanent hereditary rights in the jagir.\\nThe initial presumption therefore that jagirs are only for the lifetime of the grantee must prevail in the present case till we come to the sanad of 1918.\\nTherefore upto that time it must be (1) A.I.R. 1952 Hyd. 163, 167.\\n631 held that the jagirs were held by various ancestors of the respondent only for their lives.\\nIn such a case where a grant is continued in a family from generation to generation and each grantee holds it for his life the limitation against any one grantee starts to run from the date his title arose.\\nThis was recognized by the Privy Council in Jagdish Narayan vs Nawab Saeed Ahmed Khan (1), where it was observed that where each grantee holds an estate for his lifetime the limitation would start to run against an heir from the date when his title accrued on the death of the previous heir.\\nFrom the very fact that the grant of a jagir is only for the life time of the grantee and that his son when he gets the jagir gets a fresh grant, it follows that it was not open to a jagirdar to make an alienation which would enure beyond his lifetime and thus a jagirdar could not grant a permanent lease, unless he was specifically entitled to do so, under the sanad or the law of the State.\\nSimilarly in such cases limitation would only run against an heir from the date when his title accrued on the death of the previous heir.\\nConsequently the appellants cannot take advantage of what happened in 1875 in the time of Raja Ramarao as the starting point of adverse possession against the respondent.\\nSo far as the respondent is concerned, he apparently succeeded to the jagir in 1910 and in his case limitation would start from 1910.\\nThe present suit was brought in 1920 and therefore so far as the respondent is concerned, there is no question of perfecting even the limited title by adverse possession as against him. ' Learned counsel for the appellant drew our attention in this connection to the case of Daivasikhamani (2), where the Privy Council held that the suits were barred under article 144 of the Limitation Act.\\nThat was however a case where a permanent kowl of temple lands was granted by a manager.\\nIt was held in view of certain facts proved in that case that the lessee had acquired permanent rights by adverse pos session, even though the manager of a temple has no authority, except in certain circumstances, to grant a permanent lease.\\nThat case is in our opinion clearly (1) A.I.R. 1946 P.C. 59.\\n(2) (1935)) 1 [I.L. R 632 distinguishable from the facts of the present case.\\nIt is true that the manager of a temple has generally speaking no authority except in certain circumstances to grant a permanent lease of temple property; there fore a permanent lease granted by the manager of a temple may be voidable but is not void ab initio and so unless it is avoided by the succeeding manager, it may not be rendered inoperative.\\nFurther the temple in that case was the owner of the property and there was no question of any succession from father to son.\\nIn the case of a jagir on the other hand, the holder for the time being is not the owner of the property; his son when he succeeds holds the property as a fresh grantee and not on the basis of hereditary succession.\\nA jagirdar has no right to make a permanent alienation of any part of the jagir granted to him; if he makes a permanent alienation even by way of permanent lease the same may be good in his lifetime, but it is void and inoperative after his death; the succeeding jagirdar need not avoid it; he can just ignore it as void.\\nTherefore, while it may be possible in the case of a permanent lease granted by a manager of a temple which is the owner of the property to prescribe for a limited permanent interest by adverse possession it would be impossible to do so in the case of a jagir, for the limitation in such a case would start to run against the heir from the date when his title accrues on the death of the previous heir and no advantage can be taken of any running of time against the previous holder of the jagir.\\nBesides, in the case of such temple grants, long lapse of time may sometimes give rise to the inference that the alienation was in such circumstances as would justify a permanent lease.\\nNo such inference is however possible in the case of permanent leases granted by jagirdars.\\nIn this view therefore the case of the appellants that they have prescribed for the limited interest of a permanent lessee against the respondent must fail.\\nThe appeal therefore.\\nfails and is hereby dismissed with costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n\",\n          \"Appeal No. 255 of 1961.\\nAppeal from the judgment and order dated March 21, 1960, of the Mysore High Court in Writ Petition No. 147 of 1958.\\nB.

Factories situated outside Mysore .State effected by the dealers M/s. Cement Marketing Company of India Ltd. Bangalore, to dealers and customers in Mysore State amounts to intrastate sales and therefore liable to Mysore Sales Tax Act 48\\\".\\n784 In its judgment the High Court took into consideration the fact that the first appellant had a branch office at Bangalore within the State of Mysore and that the public placed their orders with the first appellant for supplies of cement against permits granted to them; that the first appellant, who after accepting the offer for the supplies of cement, collected the price from the intending purchasers and then directed one of the factories of the second appellant to supply cement to the purchasers and actual delivery to the purchaser was within the State) of Mysore and therefore the contention that cement was loaded outside the State of Mysore and despatched to the purchaser did not not convert sales into inter State sales but were intra state sales.\\nIt appears that the true nature of the transaction was not correctly considered by the High Court, The modus operandi above mentioned shows that before an intending purchaser could obtain cement he had to get what is called an authorisation from a Government authority which nominated the factory from which the intending purchaser had to get his supplies of cement.\\nThat authorisation with an order had to be given to the first appellant; and after a contract in the standard form was entered into the first appellant sent the order to the factory named in the authorisation and that factory then supplied the requisite goods to the purchaser.\\nThe factory from where the cement was to be supplied was not in the hands or at the option of the first appellant, but was entirely a matter for the Government authority to decide, so that the cement which was supplied from a particular factory was supplied not at the choice of the first appellant but pursuant to the authorisation.\\nIt was contended that the sales which took place in the present case in which the movement of 785 goods was from one State to another as a result of a covenant or incident of the contract of sale fell within article 286(2) of the Constitution and therefore the imposition 'of Sales tax on such sales was unconstitutional.\\nThe Article applicable at the relevant time i.e., before its amendment was as follows: 286 (1) \\\"No law of a State shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place.\\n(a) outside the State; or (b) in the course of the import of the goods into or export of the goods out of, the territory of India.\\nExplanation . . . . .\\n(2) Except in so far as Parliament may by law otherwise provide, no law of a State shall impose, or authorise the imposition of, a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter State or commerce: Provided. . . . . . \\\" The Article had since been repealed and another substituted in its place by the Constitution (Sixth Amendment) Act but the sales in question were prior to the amendment.\\nIn the present case the contract itself involved the movement of goods from the factory to the purchaser i. e. across the broder from one State to another because the factories were outside the State of Mysore and therefore transactions were 786 clearly transactions of sale of goods in the course of inter State trade or commerce.\\nTaking the nature of the transaction and preliminaries which are necessary for the sale or purchase of cement it cannot be said that the sale itself did not occasion the movement of goods from one State to another.\\nThe essential features of the contracts proved in the present case are analogous to those in M/s. Mohan Lai Hargovind vs The State of Madhya Pradesh.(1) In that case the assessees were a firm carrying on business of making and selling birds in Madhya Pradesh.\\nIn the course of their business they imported finished tobacco from dealers in Bombay State, rolled it into biris and exported the biris to various other States.\\nBoth the exporters of tobacco from Bombay State who supplied the assessees and the assessees were registered dealers under the C. P. & Berar Sales Tax Act., 1947.\\nIt was held that the asessees imported the finished tobacco into Madhya Pradesh from persons who were carrying on in the State of Bombay business of processing tobacco and selling the goods and there was, as a result of these transactions movement of goods from the State of Bombay to the State of Madhya Pradesh and therefore the transactions involved movement of goods across the State border and they were not liable to be taxed by virtue of article 286 (2) of the Constitution.\\nIn The State of Pravancore Cochin & Others vs The Bombay Co Ltd. (1) which was a case under article 286 (1) (b) i. e. sale and purchase in the course of export trade, Patanjali Sastri, C. J., observed: \\\"A sale by export thus involves a series of integrated activities commencing from the agreement of sale with a foreign buyer and ending with the delivery of the goods to a common carrier for transport out of the (1) (2) (1952) section C. R. III2.\\n787 country by land or sea.\\nSuch a sale cannot be dissociated from the export without which it cannot be effectuated, and the sale and resultant export from parts of a single transactions.\\nAt p. 1120 the learned Chief Justice again observed: \\\"We accordingly hold that whatever else may or may not fall within article 286 (1) sales and purchases which themselves occasion the export or the import of the goods, as the case may be, out of or into the territory of India come within the exemption and that is enough to dispose of these appeals\\\".\\nThus a sale to fall within article 286 (1) (b) has to be a sale which occasions the export.\\nAgain in the, State of Travancore Cochin & Other8 vs Shammugha Vilas Cashew Nut Factory & Other8 (1) the words \\\"in the course of\\\" were interpreted to mean a sale taking place not only during the activities directed to the end of exportation of the goods out of the contury but also as a part of or connected with such activities.\\nAt p. 63 the learned Chief Justice explained the words \\\"integrated activities\\\" as follows: \\\"The phrase \\\"integrated activities\\\" was used in the previous decision to denote that \\\"such a sale\\\" (i. e. a sale which occasions the export) \\\"cannot be dissociated from the export without which it cannot be affectuated, and the sale and the resultant export form parts of a single transaction '.\\nIt is in that sense that the two activities the sale and the export were said to be integrated\\\".\\nIn Endu puri Narasiham & Son vs The State of Orissa, it was held in the case of sales covered (1) ; (2) ; 788 by article 286 (1) (b) that only Bale or purchase 'of goods which occasions the export or import of the goods out of or into the territory of India were exempt from the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods and in regard to prohibition against imposition of tax on inter State sales the test, it was said, was that in order that a sale or purchase might be inter State it is essential that there must be transport of goods from one State to another under the contract of sale or purchase.\\nThe following observatins from the Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. vs The State of Bihar (1) were quoted with approval in support of the position: \\\"A sale could be said to be in the course of inter State trade only if two conditions concur: (1) A sale of goods, and (2) a transport of those goods from one State to another under the contract of sale.\\nUnless both these conditions are satisfied, there can be no sale in the course of inter State trade\\\".\\nThus the tests which have been laid down to bring a sale within inter State sales are that the transaction must involve movement of goods across the border (Mohanlal Hargovind 's case (2) ); transactions are inter State in which as a direct result of such sales the goods are actually delivered for consumption in another State; M/s Ram Narain It Ssns V. Assistant Commissioner of Sales tax (3) a contract of sale must involve transport of goods from one State to another under the contract of sale; Bengal Immunity Co ' case (1).\\nin the case of sales in the course of export or import the test laid down was a series of integrated activitiesm commencing from an agreement of sale and ending with the delivery of goods to a common (1) , 784 5 (2) (1965) 2 S.G R. 509.\\n(3) ; , 504.\\n789 carrier for export by land or by sea ; The Bombay Co. Ltd, case (1).\\n\\\"In the course of\\\" was explained to mean a sale taking place not only during the activities directed to the end of the exportation of the goods out of the country but also as part of or connected with such activities and \\\"integrated activities\\\" was explained in similar langauage.\\nThis Court again accepted these tests in Endupuri Narasim ham 's case (2).\\nIn a. 3 of the (Act 74 of 1956), the legislature has accepted the principal governing inter State sales as laid down in mohan Hargovind 's case (3).\\nThe principles for determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes place in the course of inter state sale or commerce outside the state are : \\\"S.3 A sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place in the course of inter State trade or commerce if the sale or pur chase (a) occasions the movement of goods from one State to another ; or (b) is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods during their movement from one State to another\\\".\\nIn Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd, Bombay vs S.R. Sarkar & Another (4) Shah, J., in explaining what sales are covered by el.\\n(a) of s.3 above said : \\\"Cl.\\n(a) of a. 3 covers sales, other than those included in Cl.\\n(b), in which the movement of goods from one state to another is the result of a convenant or incident of the contract of sale.\\nand property in the goods passes in either State .\\n\\\" As stated above under the contracts of sale in the present case there was transport of goods from (1) (3) (1955) 2 S.G.R. 509.\\n(2) ; (4) ; ,391, 790 outside the State of Mysore into the State of Mysore and the transactions themselves involved movement of goods across the border.\\nThus if the goods moved under the contract of sale, it cannot be said that they were intrastate sales.\\nIt was not the volition of the first appellant to supply to the purchaser the goods from any of the factories of the second appellant.\\nThe factories were nominated by the Government by authorisations which formed the basis of the contract between the buyer and the seller.\\nApplying these tests to the facts of the present case we are of the opinion that the sales were in the nature of inter State sales and were exempt from Sales tax.\\nIn these circumstances the contracts of sale in the present case have been erroneously considered to be intrastate sales.\\nThe decision in Rohtas Industrieg Ltd. vs The State of Bihar (1) to which reference was made by the respondent does not apply to the facts of the present case because the agreement between the first appellant and the second appellant is different from that which existed between Rohtas Industries Ltd. and the Cement Marketing Co of India in the case above cited.\\n(in an examination of the agreement between those two companies this court held that the rotation.\\nship which existed between the two was of seller and buyer and not of principal agent.\\nIn the present case the agreement is quite different.\\nIn the first clause of the agreement between the two appellants and the Patimia Cement Co. dated April 21, 1954, the first appellant was appointed the sole and exclusive Sales Manager of the second appellant and as such the first appellant was entitled to enter into contracts of sale, receive payment of the same and do all seta and things necessary for the effective management in connection with the contracts of sale entered into on behalf of the principals.\\nThe sale price and the terms and conditions of sale were to be (1) (1961) 12 S.T.C. 615.\\n791 determined by the principals.\\nThe Sales Manager was to keep its administrative and technical staff at such places in India as was determined by the principals.\\nAll the establishment charges and other expenses of the Sales Managers were for and on behalf of the principals and were to be defrayed by the principals in proportion to their annual sales.\\nAt the end of every mouth the Sales Managers were to submit to the principals accounts showing sales con tracts by it on behalf of each one of the principals.\\nAt the end of each financial year ending July 31 the Sales Managers had to make a. proper account of all their operations during the year and after submitting them for confirmation to the principals had to pay the price of annual sales realizations to each of the principals to whom they happened to relate.\\nClause to provided that subject to instructions of the principals the Sales Managers were to make all necessary arrangements to secure speedy and economicial transport of cement.\\nThese terms are quite different from those in the case of Rohtas Industries Ltd. and therefore that decision has no application to the facts of the present case.\\nIn the result, the imposition of the Sales tax on the appellant for the year of assessment except for the period April 1, 1955, to September 6, 1955, was illegal and was not leviable for that period.\\nThe appeal is therefore allowed to that extent and the petition of the appellants succeeds but it will not effect the tax paid for the period abovementioned.\\nIn view of the partial success of appellants they will be entitled to half costs of the appeal.\\nAppeal allowed in part.\\n(1) (1961) 12 S.T.C. 615.\\n\",\n          \"77 of 1958.\\nPetition Under article 32 of the Constitution of India for enforcement of Fandamental Rights.\\nBhavani Lal and P.

DAS, J.\\nThis is a writ petition under article 32 of the Constitution.\\nThe petitioners, Messrs. Nand Lal Raj Kishan, carry on a business of commission agents at Delhi and are liable to pay sales tax in respect of their business under the provisions of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, as in force in Delhi.\\nThey filed returns for four quarters of 195455 and claimed exemption in respect of sales of certain goods to the registered dealers under the provi sions of section 5(2)(a)(ii) of the said Act.\\nBy his order dated April 11, 1956, the Sales Tax Officer disallowed the exemption claimed by the petitioners mainly on the ground that the alleged sales were made to \\\"those 285 registered dealers whose activities had gone underground.\\\" The Sales.\\nTax Officer issued a demand notice for a sum of Rs. 1,11,890 11 0 on account of sales tax.\\nThe petitioners then carried an appeal to the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax, Delhi.\\nThe Assistant Commissioner set aside the order of the Sales Tax Officer and remanded the case for a fresh decision in the light of certain judgments given by the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, in a number of similar cases.\\nIn the meantime the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, was amended by the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) (Delhi Amendment) Act, 1956, being Act No. 17 of 1956.\\nThis amending Act which came into force on October 27, 1956, inserted a new section, which is section 8A of the Act.\\nThis section reads as follows: \\\"section 8A. Security from certain class of dealers.\\nThe Commissioner, if it appears to him to be necessary so to do for the proper realisation of the tax levied under this Act, may impose for reasons to be recorded in writing as a condition of the issue of a registration certificate to a dealer or of the continuance, in effect, of such a certificate issued to any dealer, a requirement that the dealer shall give security up to ail amount and in the manner approved by the Commissioner for the payment of the tax for which he may be or become liable under this Act.\\n\\\" On May 17, 1957, the petitioners asked for a fresh registration certificate on the ground that their original certificate had been lost in transit.\\nThey further asked for the addition of some more items of goods in the registration certificate, such as cigarettes, bidis and glass of all kinds.\\nThereupon the Sales Tax Officer made certain enquiries and found that the petitioners had been frequently shifting their places of business and the sales alleged to have been made by them to some registered dealers were not genuine, because those persons could not be traced at the addresses given.\\nOn a report being submitted to the Commissioner of Sales Tax, Delhi, the Commissioner asked the Sales Tax Officer to issue a notice to the petitioners.\\nOn 286 July 13,1957, such a notice was issued to the petitioners to show cause why they should not be asked to furnish a security of Rs. 10,000 in accordance with the provisions of section 8A.\\nThe petitioners then appeared before the Sales Tax Officer and made a statement that they were not prepared to deposit any amount as security.\\nThey also filed a written explanation objecting to the demand of security.\\nThe matter was then referred to the Commissioner of Sales Tax who con sidered the explanation of the petitioners and the report of the Sales Tax Officer.\\nThe Commissioner expressed his finding in the following words: \\\"In view of the reputation that the dealer enjoys in the market, namely, that he being a commission agent has been engaged in the business of selling goods to other commission agents, all sales being effected to unscrupulous registered dealers, frequent changes in the name and place of busines s without giving specific details, late submission of information regarding the changes: in the name and place of business, non submission of returns for the year 1956 57 within the prescribed time, it appears neces sary to demand security under section 8A of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941 as in force in Delhi.\\n\\\" Accordingly, on November 27, 1957, he made an order directing the petitioners to furnish security either in cash or by two personal sureties for a Bum of Rs. 5,000 by December 15, 1957.\\nAgainst the aforesaid order of the Commissioner the petitioners went in revision to the Chief Commissioner of Delhi.\\nThe Chief Commissioner heard Counsel for the petitioners and by his order dated April 15, 1958, dismissed the application in revision.\\nThe petitioners then filed a writ petition in the Punjab High Court which was summarily dismissed.\\nOn the present writ petition the petitioners have impugned the order of the Commissioner dated November 27, 1957 on the ground that section 8A of the Act under which the order was passed is constitutionally invalid.\\nThey have challenged the validity of section 8A on three grounds: firstly, it is contended that section 8A 287 gives an undefined, unlimited and unrestricted power to the Commissioner of Sales Tax; secondly, it is contended that no limit is fixed with regard to the amount of security which may be demanded under the section; and thirdly, it is contended that the section imposes an unreasonable restriction on the right of the petitioners to carry on their business inasmuch as it does not provide for any enquiry before the demand for security is made, nor does it provide for an opportunity being given to the person against whom the order is proposed to be passed of being heard before such order is passed.\\nWe do not think that these grounds have any substance.\\nSection 8A does not give unlimited or unrestricted power.\\nto the Commissioner of Sales Tax.\\nIt states inter alia that the Commissioner may impose for reasons to be recorded in writing as a condition of the issue of registration Certificate to a dealer, or of the continuance of such a certificate, a requirement that the dealer shall give security up to an amount and in the manner approved by the Commissioner for the payment of the tax for which he may be or become liable under the Act: this power of the Commissioner is, however, subject to the condition that it must \\\"appear to him to be necessary so to do for the proper realisation of the tax levied under the Act\\\".\\nIn other words, the Commissioner may exercise his power of demanding security only when he considers it necessary to do so for the proper realisation of the tax levied under the Act.\\nBy no stretch of argument can it be suggested that the power is an unlimited or an unrestricted power.\\nLearned Counsel for the petitioners has referred us to the decision of this Court in Messrs. Duarka Prasad Laxmi Narain vs The State of Uttar Pradesh (1).\\nThat was a case in which under cl.\\n4(3) of the Uttar Pradesh Coal Control Order, 1953, the licensing authority was, given absolute power to grant or refuse to grant, renew or refuse to renew suspend, revoke, cancel or modify any licence under the Order.\\nIt was pointed out by this Court that there was nothing to regulate or guide the discretion (1)[1954] S.C.R. 803.\\n288 of the licensing officer and the provision impugned therein committed to the unrestrained will of a single individual the power to grant, withhold or cancel licences in any way he chose.\\nThat is not the position here.\\nSection 8A itself gives the necessary guidance when it says that the Commissioner may exercise his power only when it is necessary to do so for the proper realisation of the tax levied under the Act.\\nIn a later decision of this Court in Virendra vs The State of Punjab (1) it was pointed out that in Dwarka Prasad 's case (1) the impugned provision prescribed no principles and gave no guidance in the matter of the exercise of the power, but in a case where the exercise of the power is conditioned by the statute itself, the ratio in Dwarka Prasad case (2) does not apply.\\nThe same view was reiterated in Kishan Chand Arora vs The Commissioner of Police, Calcutta (3).\\nSection 7(4a)(i) of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, gives the power to the Commissioner to demand reasonable security for the proper payment of tax payable under the Act.\\nThis section came in for consideration of the Calcutta High Court in Durga Prasad Khaitan vs Commercial Tax Officer (4) and it was held that the section did not confer unfettered or arbitrary power to the Commissioner.\\nWe approve of the view expressed therein that the power to levy a tax includes the power to impose reasonable safeguards in collecting it, and demanding security for the proper payment of the tax payable under the Act is neither an arbitrary nor an unreasonable restriction.\\nAs to the contention that there,is no limit to the amount which can be demanded as security, it is only necessary to point out that the amount that can be demanded as security must have relation to the payment of the tax for which the person concerned may be or become liable under the Act.\\nThe amount must depend on the nature of the business, its turnover and the amount of tax payable thereon by the person concerned.\\nFurthermore, the order of the Commissioner under section 8A is subject to revision by the Chief (1) ; , 321 (3) ; (2)[1954] S.C.R. 803.\\n(4)[1937] 8 S.T.C. 105.\\n289 Commissioner and if an arbitrary or unreasonable amount is demanded, the order of the Commissioner will be subject to scrutiny by the Chief Commissioner.\\nWe do not think that even in the matter of the amount of security, the power of the Commissioner is unlimited or unrestricted.\\nAs to the last contention that the section does not provide for any enquiry or any opportunity being given to the person against whom the order is proposed to be passed of being heard, this point was taken before the Chief Commissioner and the Chief Commissioner rightly pointed out that the principles of natural justice would apply and the person to whose prejudice the order is to be made must be given an opportunity to say whatever he has to say in his defence.\\nIn the present case such an opportunity was given to the petitioners.\\nA notice was issued to the petitioners by the Sales Tax Officer.\\nThe petitioners appeared before the Sales Tax Officer, submitted a written explanation and also made oral submissions.\\nThe Commissioner had before him the report of the Sales Tax Officer, the explanation submitted by the petitioners in reply to the notice issued, and also the statements made by them.\\nIt has been contended on behalf of the petitioners that no oral hearing was given to the petitioners by the Commissioner of Sales Tax and learned Counsel for the petitioners has made a grievance that the order of the Commissioner was passed without hearing the petitioners.\\nIt may be pointed out here that when the petitioners were heard by the Chief Commissioner in support of their application in revision, they made no grievance on the score that the Commissioner of Sales Tax had not given them a second opportunity of a fresh oral hearing.\\nWe do not think that a second opportunity like the one suggested on behalf of the petitioners was either necessary or obligatory.\\nThe petitioners had an opportunity of saying what they had to say against the demand of security.\\nThey raised their objections which were considered by the Commissioner who, in spite of those objections, came to the conclusion that it was necessary to ask the petitioners 37 290 to furnish security for the proper realisation of the tax levied or leviable under the Act.\\nWe agree with the Chief Commissioner that there was no violation of the principles of natural justice in the present case.\\nFor the reasons given above we hold that there is no merit in the petition which is accordingly dismissed with costs.\\nPetition dismissed.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dataset_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

commission of an offence under section 7 read with section 16(1)(a)(i) of the for selling adulterated ghee.\\nThe analysis of the ghee had disclosed that it had a Reichert Value of only 22 5 whereas the minimum Reichert value fixed for Uttar Pradesh, where the respondent sold the ghee, was 28.\\nThe defence of the respondent was that he had obtained the ghee which he sold from Jodhpur where the Reichert value fixed was only 22 and that the sample must be held not to be adulterated on the basis of the decision of the Allahabad High Court in State vs Malik Ram, A.1,R. 1962 All.\\nThis decision laid down that a distinction should be made between ghee obtained from cattle in the hill districts and ghee obtained from cattle in the plains and that ghee obtained from the hill districts of U.P. cannot be held to be adulterated if its Reichert value was equal to that prescribed for Himachal Pradesh which is a hilly area.\\nIt was the contention of the respondent that his ghee was admittedly pahadi ghee and therefore this decision would apply.\\nThe First Class Magistrate rejected these contentions and convicted him and sentenced him to six months ' R.I. and a fine of Rs. 500.\\nOn appeal the Sessions Judge concurred in the findings of the trial court but reduced the sentence.\\nThe respondent thereupon filed a Criminal Revision Petition before the High Court.\\nThe High Court agreed with the courts below that the ghee was not Jodhpur ghee but it was produced locally.\\nBut it held that the Reichert values as fixed were not based on any reasonable classification and therefore it was sufficient if a vendor satisfied the minimum standard prescribed for any area in the country and since the minimum prescribed for certain areas is 21 and since the ghee in question had 22 2 the respondent was not guilty of the offence charged.\\nThe State thereupon appealed to this Court by way of a certificate under article 134(1)(e) of the Constitution.\\nIt was urged by the appellant that the High Court was wrong in striking down or re drafting the rules framed by the Central Government in the manner in which the High Court has done purporting to invoke 680 article 14 of the Constitution and virtually setting up what the High Court considered was the reasonable standard.\\nHeld: (i) Where the Government have prescribed certain standards after taking into considerations various factors the court cannot strike down these standards as unreasonable or discriminatory merely on some priori reasoning.\\nIt can do so only by basing its decision on materials placed before it by way of scientific analysis.\\nThe party invoking article 14 must make averments with details to sustain such a plea and lead evidence to establish his allegations.\\nIn the absence of such plea and evidence the court cannot accept the statement of a party as to the unconstitutionality of a rule and refuse to enforce that rule as it stands merely because in its view the standards are too high and for this reason the rule is unreasonable.\\n(ii) Applying these principles it is found that the case State vs Malik Ram (A.I.R. 1962 All. 156) was wrongly decided by the Allahabad High Court.\\nIn the case under appeal the High Court took the matter a step further and adopted the lowest Reichert value prescribed for any area in the country as what should be adopted for every other area in the

Sinha (P. K. Bose, with him) for the appel lant.\\nN.C. Chatterjee and Panchanan Ghosh (Chandra Narayan Naik, with them) for the respondent. 1950.\\nDecember 1.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by PATANJALI SASTRI J.\\nThis appeal arises out of a suit brought by the respondent in the court of the Subordinate Judge, Dhanbad, for recovery of arrears of royalty and cess from the appellant and another alleged to be due under a compromise decree passed on the 6th March, 1923, in a previ ous suit between the predecessors in interest of the par ties.\\nThe only plea which is material for the purpose of this appeal is that the compromise decree not having been registered was inadmissible in evidence.\\nThe courts below held that the document did not require registration and gave effect to its terms in decreeing the suit.\\nThe second defendant has preferred this appeal.\\nThe facts are not now in dispute and may be briefly stated.\\nOn 11th March, 1921, one Kumar Krishna Prasad Singh (hereinafter referred to as Kumar) granted a perma nent lease of the right to the underground coal in 5,800 bighas of land belonging to him to Shibsaran Singh and Sitaram Singh (hereinafter referred to as the Singhs) by a registered patta stipulating for a salami of Rs. 8,000 and royalty at the rate of 2a.\\nper ton of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 8,000 and for certain other cesses and interest.\\nOn 7th June, 1921, Kumar executed another perma nent patta leasing the right to the coal in 500 bighas out of the 5,800 bighas referred to above to one Prayngji Bal lavji Deoshi and his son Harakchand Deoshi (hereinafter referred to as the Deoshis).\\nBy this document.\\n835 the Deoshis agreed inter alia to pay royalty at the rate of 2a. per ton on all classes of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 750 a year.\\nThe Singhs feeling themselves aggrieved by the latter transaction brought a title suit (No. 1291 of 1921) in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhanbad for a declaration of their title and for possession of the 500 bighas leased to the Deoshis under the aforesaid patta of 7th June, 1921.\\nTo that suit Kumar was made a party as defendant No. 3, the Deoshis being defendants 1 and 2.\\nThe suit was however cornpromised on 6th March, 1923, by all the parties and a decree based on the compromise was also passed on the same day.\\nThe interest of the Singhs was brought to sale in 193S in execution of a decree obtained against them and was purchased by the plaintiff who insti tuted the presnt suit on 3rd October, 1942, claiming the royalty and cesses payable under the compromise decree for the period from Pous 1345 to Asadh 1349 B.S. from defendants 1 and 2 as the representatives of the Deoshis who entered into the compromise of March, 1923.\\nIn order to appreciate the contentions of the parties, it is necessary to set out the relevant terms of the compro mise decree which are as follows : \\\"The plaintiffs (the Singhs) within two months from this date shall pay Rs. 8,000 as salami to defendant No. 3 (Kumar).\\nOtherwise all the terms of the compromise Will stand cancelled and the plaintiffs shall not be competent to claim any right to or possession over the.land covered by the patta dated 11th March, 1921.\\nThe patta which defend ant No. 3 executed in favour of the plaintiffs in respect of 5,800 bighas of coal land in village Rahraband shall remain in force, and the plaintiffs will get a decree of declara tion of their right and title to the 500 bighas of coal land in dispute but defendants 1 and 2 (the Deoshis) shall hold possession as tenants.\\nBesides the terms mentioned below, defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound by all the remaining terms under which they took settlement of the 500 bighas of coal land from defendant No. 3 under 836 patta and Kabuliyat, and both the defendants 1 and 2 shall possess the same under the plaintiffs from generation to generation and all the terms of the said patta and Kabuliyat shall remain effective and in force between them.\\nBoth the defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound to pay to the plain tiffs commission at the rate of 2a.\\nper ton on all sorts of coal instead of 2a.\\na ton as stated before in the patta of 5,800 bighas of land settled with the plaintiffs.\\nThe plaintiffs shall pay to defendant No. 3 in future the mini mum royalty of Rs. 6,000 instead of Rs. 8,000 as stipulated in the original patta of 11 th March 1921 and commission at the rate of la.\\na ton in place of 2a.\\na ton as stipulat ed in the patta of March 21 .\\nUnless the plaintiffs pay to the defendant No. 3 Rs. 8,000 within 2 months from this day they shall not be competent to take out execution of this decree, nor shall they be competent to take posses sion of the land in dispute.\\nThe defendants 1 and 2 within one month from the date of payment of Rs. 8,000 as aforesaid to defendant No. 3 shall execute a new Kabuliyat in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the modified terms stated above, i.e., on the condition to pay commission at the rate of 2a.\\nper ton.\\nIn the new patta which defendant No. 3 will execute in favour of the plaintiffs he shall embody the condition that the annual minimum royalty will be Rs. 6,000 instead of Rs. 8,000 and commission will be at the rate of la. 9p.\\nper ton in place of 2a.\\nper ton as mentioned in the aforesaid patta.\\nIf the defendant No. 3 does not execute the parts on the aforesaid modified terms in favour 'of the plaintiffs within the time aforesaid and both the defendants 1 and 2 also do not execute a kabuliyat on the aforesaid modified terms, then this very rafanama shall be treated as the parts and kabuliyat, and the plaintiffs in accordance with the terms of the rafanama shall pay to defendant No. 3, Rs. 6,000 only as minimum royalty and commission at the rate of la.\\nper ton with respect to 5,800 bighas and shall continue to realise commission at the rate of 2a. 6p. per ton from defendants 1 and 2 who shall remain bound to pay the same.\\n\\\" 837 The answer to the question whether this compromise decree requires registration depends on the legal effect of the changes in the status quo ante of the parties brought about by the document.\\nA careful analysis reveals the following alterations : (1) In the lease to the Singhs, the rate of royalty or commission was reduced from 2a.\\nper ton of coal raised to la.\\nper ton and the minimum royalty was reduced from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 6,000 while the area of coal land in their khas possession was reduced by 500 bighas. (2) In the lease to the Deoshis the rate of royalty or commission was enhanced from 2a.\\nper ton to 2a.\\nper ton and tiffs was made payable to the Singhs.\\nThe Singhs and the Deoshis were brought into a new legal relationship, the former accepting the latter as tenants holding the disputed 500 bighas under them in consideration of the latter agreeing to pay the enhanced royalty to the former. (4) The whole arrangement was made conditional on the Singhs paying Rs. 8,000 to Kumar within 2 months from the date of the compromise, it being expressly provided that the Singhs were not to be entitled to execute the decree or to take possession of the disputed area of 503 bighas which evidently had not till then passed into their possession.\\nNow, sub section (1) of section 17 of the , enumerates five categories of documents of which regis tration is made compulsory which include\\\" (d) leases of immoveable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent;\\\".\\nSub sec tion (2) however provided that \\\"nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub section (1)applies to . (vi) any decree or order of court.\\n\\\" It may be mentioned in passing that this clause was amended with affect from the 1st April, 1930, by the , so as to exclude from the scope of the exception compromise decrees comprising immovable property other than that which is the subject matter of the suit.\\nBut 838 the amendment cannot affect the document here in question which came into existence in 1923.\\nBefore the amendment, the clause was held to cover even compromise decrees comprising immovable property which was not the subject matter of the suit: [Vide Hemanta Kumari Debi vs Midnapur Zamindari Co. ( ')].\\nThat decision applies to the present case and obviates the objection that because the compromise in question covered also the remaining 5,300 bighas which were not the subject matter of the title suit of 1921, it was outside the scope of the exception in sub section (2), clause (vi).\\nThe only question, therefore, is whether the compromise decree is a \\\"lease\\\" [which expression includes \\\"an agreement to lease\\\" by the definition in section 2 (7)] within the meaning of el.\\n(d) of sub section (1).\\nIt is obvious that if the compromise decree fails within clause (d) of sub section (1) it would not be protected under clause (vi) of sub section (2) which excepts only documents falling under the categories (b) and (c) of sub section (1).\\nThe High Court was of opinion that, on a proper construction of the terms of the compromise, it did not fall under clause (d).\\nMano har Lall J., who delivered the leading judgment, observed: \\\"It was a tripartite agreement embodied in the decree of the court and was, therefore, exempt from registration.\\nIt will be oh.served also that so far as the defendants were con cerned, their possession of the 500 bighas was not inter fered with and they still remained in possession as the lessees, but instead of paying the royalty to the plaintiffs it was agreed between all the parties that the defendants would pay the royalty in future to Shibsaran and Sitcram.\\nIf the matter had stood there, the learned Advocate for the appellant could not have seriously contested the position, but he vehemently argued that when the agreement was not to pay the same amount of royalty or commission as previously agreed to but an altered amount of royalty and commission, the document should be held to fall within the mischief of section 17 (1)(d)of the (1) P.C. 839 .\\nThe answer to this contention is, as I have stated just now, to be found in the Full Bench decision of this court :\\\" [see Charu Chandra Mitra 's case ()].\\nIt was there held that a mere alteration of the rent reserved does not make the transaction a new lease so as to bring it within clause (d)of subsection (1).\\nWe are unable to share this view.\\nIt oversimplifies the compromise transaction which, in our opinion, involves much more than a mere alteration of the royalties stipulated for in the previous pattas executed by Kumar.\\nNor can we accept the suggestion of Mr. Chatterjee for the respondents theft the compromise operated as an assignment to the Singhs by Kumar of the latter 's reversion under the \\\"lease granted to the Deoshis and all that the latter did was to acknowledge the Singhs as their landlords and attern to them.\\nOn tiffs view it was said that the transaction would not fall under clause (d), although it would fall under clause (b) but then would be saved by the exception in clause (vi) of sub section (2).\\nThe argument, however, overlooks that Kumar had leased the area of 5,800 bighas to the Singhs by his patta dated 11th March, 1921, and the compromise by providing that the Singhs should pay the reduced royalty of 1a.\\nper ton in respect of the whole area preserved Kumar 's reversion intact.\\nHe could not therefore be deemed to have assigned any part of his inter est in 5,800 bighas as landlord to the Singhs who continue to hold the entire extent as tenants under him.\\nWhat the compromise really did was.\\nas stated already, to bring the Singhs and the Deoshis into a new legal relationship as underlessor and under lessee in respect of 500 bighas which were the subject matter of the title suit; in other words, its legal effect was to create a perpetual underlease be tween the Singhs and the Deoshis which would clearly fall under clause (d) but for the circumstance that it was to take effect only on condition float the Singhs paid Rs. 8,000 to Kumar within 2 months (1) 840 thereafter.\\nAs pointed out by the Judicial Committee in Hemanta Kumar 's case (1) \\\"An agreement for a lease, which a lease is by the statute declared to include, must, in their Lordships ' opinion, be a document which effects an actual demise and operates as a lease .\\nThe phrase which in the context where it occurs and in the statute in which it is found, must in their opinion relate to some document which creates a present and immediate interest in the land.\\n\\\" The compromise decree expressly provides that unless the sum of Rs. 8,000 was paid within the stipulated time the Singhs were not to execute the decree or to take possession of the disputed property.\\nUntil the payment was made it was impossible to determine whether there would be any under lease or not.\\nSuch a contingent agreement is not within clause (d) and although it is covered by clause (b). is excepted by clause (vi) of sub section ( '2).\\nWe therefore agree with the conclusion of the High Court though on dif ferent grounds and dismiss the appeal with costs.\\nAppeal dismisseel.\\n\",\n          \"Appeal No. 198 of 1954.\\nAppeal from the judgment and order dated October 16, 1952, of the former Nagpur High Court in Misc. Petn.; No. 1231 of 1951.\\nM. section K. Sastri, for the appellant.\\nH. L. Khaskalam, B. K. B. Naidu and I. N. Shroff, for the respondent.\\n64 502 1960.\\nNovember 18.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by IMAM, J.\\nThis is an appeal from the judgment of the Nagpur High Court dismissing the appellants petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.\\nThe High Court certified under article 132(1) of the Constitution that the case involved a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution.\\nHence the present appeal.\\nThe appellant was the Ruler of the State of Baster.\\nAfter the passing of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the appellant executed an Instrument of Accession to the Dominion of India on August 14, 1947.\\nThereafter, he entered into an agreement with the Dominion of India popularly known as \\\"The Stand Still Agreement\\\".\\nOn December 15, 1947, he entered into an agreement with the Government of India whereby he ceded the State of Baster to the Government of India to be integrated with the Central Provinces and Berar (now the State of Madhya Pradesh) in such manner as the Government of India thought fit.\\nCon sequently the Governments in India came to have exclusive and plenary authority, jurisdiction and powers over the Baster State with effect from January 1, 1948.\\nThe Legislature of the State of Madhya Pradesh passed the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950 (Madhya Pradesh Act 1 of 1951), hereinafter referred to as the Act, which received the assent of the President of India on January 22, 1951.\\nThe preamble of the Act stated that it was one to provide for the acquisition of the rights of proprietors in estates, mahals, alienated villages and alienated lands in Madhya Pradesh and to make provisions for other matters connected therewith.\\nUnder section 3 of the Act, vesting of proprietary rights in the State Government takes place on certain conditions,, mentioned in that section, being complied with.\\nThe definition of 'proprietor ' is stated in section 2 cl.\\n(m) and it is \\\"in relation to 503 (i) the Central Provinces, includes an inferior proprietor, a protected thekadar or other thekadar, or protected headman; (ii) the merged territories, means a maufidar including an ex Ruler of an Indian State merged with Madhya Pradesh, a Zamindar, Ilaquedar, Khorposhdar or Jagirdar within the meaning of wajib ul arz, or any sanad, deed or other instrument, and a gaontia or a thekadar of a village in respect of which by or under the provisions contained in the wajib ul arz applicable to such village the maufidar, the gaontia, or the thekadar, as the case may be, has a right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such village;\\\".\\nThe definition of 'mahal ' is stated in section 2(j) and it is \\\"mahal\\\", in relation to merged territories, means any area other than land in possession of a raiyat which has been separately assessed to land revenue, whether such land revenue be payable or has been released, compounded for or redeemed in whole or in part;\\\".\\nBefore the High Court the appellant contended that he was still a Sovereign Ruler and absolute owner of the villages specified in Schedules A and B of his petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.\\nHe urged that his rights had been recognized and guaranteed under the agreements entered into by him with the Government of India.\\nThe provisions of the Act, therefore, did not apply to him.\\nIt was further contended that the provisions of the Act did not apply to a Ruler or to the private property of a Ruler which was not assessed to land revenue.\\nHe relied on article 6 of the Instrument of Accession and the first paragraph of article 3 of the Merger Agreement.\\nThe High Court held that if the petitioner 's rights under article 6 of the Instrument of Accession and article 3 of the Merger Agreement had been infringed it was clear from the provisions of article 363 of the Constitution that interference by the courts was barred in disputes arising out of these two instruments.\\nThe High Court was also of the opinion that article 362 of the Constitu tion was of no assistance to the appellant.\\n504 After referring to the definition of the word 'proprietor ' in the Act, the High Court was of the opinion that the word 'maufidar ' in section 2(m) of the Act had not been used in any narrow or technical sense.\\nA 'maufidar ' was not only a person to whom a grant of maufi lands had been made but was also one who held land which was exempt from the payment of \\\"rent or tax\\\".\\nIt accordingly rejected the contention on behalf of the appellant that the word 'maufidar ' is necessarily confined to a grantee from the State or Ruler and therefore a Ruler could not conceivably be a maufidar.\\nThe High Court also rejected the contention on behalf of the appellant that as he was a \\\"Ruler\\\" within the meaning of that expression in article 366(22) of the Constitution he did not come within the expression 'ex Ruler ' as contained in the definition of the word 'proprietor ' in the Act.\\nThe expression 'Ruler ' as defined in article 366(22) of the Constitution applied only for interpreting the provisions of the Constitution.\\nThe expression 'ex Ruler ' given in the Act must therefore be given the ordinary dictionary meaning.\\nAccording to Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 'Ruler ' means \\\"one who, or that which, exercises rule, especially of a supreme or sovereign kind.\\nOne who has control, management, or head ship within some limited sphere\\\".\\nThe High Court accordingly took the view that although the appellant did exercise such a rule in the past he ceased to exercise it in his former Domain after the agreements of accession and merger had come into operation.\\nAccordingly the appellant must be regarded as an ex Ruler and as he was also a maufidar he fell within the definition of the word 'proprietor ' in the Act.\\nThe question whether the villages mentioned in Schedules A and B of the petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution fell in any of the categories, \\\"Estates, Mahals, Alienated lands\\\", was also considered by the High Court.\\nIn its opinion they did not fall within the category of Estates or Alienated lands but they did fall within the category of Mahals.\\nAccording to the definition of 'Mahal ' in section 2(j) of the Act the same must be separately assessed to land 505 revenue.\\nAccording to the appellant they had not been assessed to land revenue but this was denied on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh.\\nThe High Court was of the opinion that in these circumstances it was for the appellant to establish that the villages in question had never been assessed to land revenue but no evidence had been led to this effect.\\nOn the contrary, according to the High Court, it would appear from the documents on the record that the villages known as 'Bhandar villages ' had been assessed to land revenue.\\nAs the rest of the villages in Schedule A and the villages in Schedule B, upto the date of the High Court judgment, had not been recognized as the private property of the appellant by the Government of India as required by the second and third paragraphs of the Merger Agreement, the appellant could not assert his ownership over them.\\nThe High Court, accordingly, dismissed his petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution.\\nTwo questions in the main were urged before us (1) whether the appellant is a proprietor within the meaning of that expression in the Act and (2) whether the villages in question came within the definition of the word 'mahal ' contained in the Act.\\nOn behalf of the appellant it had also been urged that the Act could not defeat the rights of the appellant guaranteed under article 3 of the Merger Agreement.\\nIt seems clear to us, however, that in view of the provisions of article 363(1) of the Constitution any dispute arising out of the Merger Agreement or the Instrument of Accession is beyond the competence of the courts to enquire into.\\nThe High Court rightly decided this point against the appellant.\\nWith reference to the first point we would first consider whether the appellant is an ex Ruler for the purposes of the Act.\\nThat he is so factually cannot be denied, since he ceded his State to the Government of India to be integrated with the Central Provinces and Berar (now the State of Madhya Pradesh) in such manner as the Government of India thought fit.\\nHe further ceded to the Government ' of India full and exclusive authority, jurisdiction and powers in relation 506 to the governance of his State when he agreed that the administration of that State would be transferred to the Government of India as from January 1, 1948.\\nThe question is whether his recognition for the purposes of the Constitution as Ruler by virtue of the provisions of article 366(22) of the Constitution of India continues his status as a Ruler for purposes other than the Constitution.\\narticle 366(22) states: \\\" \\\"Ruler\\\" in relation to an Indian State means the Prince, Chief or other person by whom any such covenant or agreement as is referred to in clause (1) of article 291 was entered into and who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Ruler of the State, and includes any person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the successor of such Ruler\\\".\\nArticle 291 refers to the privy purse payable to Rulers.\\nIt states: \\\"Where under any covenant or agreement entered into by the Ruler of any Indian State before the commencement of this Constitution, the payment of any sums, free of tax, has been guaranteed or assured by the Government of the Dominion of India to any Ruler of such State as privy purse (a) such sums shall be charged on, and paid out of, the Consolidated Fund of India; and (b) the sums so paid to any Ruler shall be exempt from all taxes on income.\\n\\\" Article 291 refers to any covenant or agreement entered into by the Ruler of any Indian State before the commencement of the Constitution.\\nThe covenant or agreement referred to in this Article certainly includes the Instrument of Accession and the Merger Agreement.\\nThe effect of the Merger Agreement is clearly one by which factually a Ruler of an Indian State ceases to be a Ruler but for the purposes of the Constitution and for the purposes of the privy purse guaranteed, he is a Ruler as defined in article 366(22) of the Constitution.\\nThere is nothing in the provisions of article 366(22) which requires a court to recognise such a person as a Ruler for purposes outside the Constitution.\\nIn our opinion, the High Court rightly held that 507 the appellant was an ex Ruler and that article 366(22) of the Constitution did not make him a Ruler for the purposes of the Act.\\nAs the appellant was an 'ex Ruler ', he was within the class of persons who were by name specifically included in the definition of 'proprietor ' and therefore clearly within the scope of the Act.\\nThat the appellant was not only an ex Ruler but a maufidar appears to us to be clear.\\nThe ordinary dictionary meaning of maufi is \\\"Released, exempted, exempt from the payment of rent or tax, rent free\\\" and maufidar is \\\"A holder of rent free land, a grantee\\\".\\nIt was common ground in the High Court that the villages in question were exempt from the payment of rent or tax.\\nIn our opinion, the High Court rightly took the view that the expression 'maufidar ' was not necessarily confined to a grantee from a State or a Ruler of a State.\\nA maufidar could be a person who was the holder of land which was exempted from the payment of rent or tax.\\nIn our opinion, the appellant certainly came within the expression 'maufidar ' besides being an ex Ruler ' of an Indian State merged with Madhya Pradesh.\\nIt is, however, contended on behalf of the appellant that the most important part of the definition was the concluding portion where it was stated that in the case of a maufidar he must be a person who by or under the provisions contained in the wajib ul arz applicable to his village, had the right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such village.\\nIt was contended that even if the appellant was a maufidar, there was nothing to show that with reference to any village held by him it was entered in the wajib ul arz, that he had a right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such village.\\nIn the petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, filed by the appellant in the High Court, it was nowhere asserted that even if he was regarded as a maufidar it was not entered in the wajib ul arz with respect to any of his maufi villages that he had a right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in such villages.\\nFrom the judgment of the High 508 Court it would appear that no such argument was advanced before it.\\nIn the application for a certificate under article 132(1) of the Constitution we can find no mention of this.\\nIn the statement of the case filed in this Court also there is no mention of this fact.\\nThere is thus no material on the record to establish that the appellant as a maufidar had no right to recover rent or revenue from persons holding land in his villages.\\nThe burden was on the appellant to prove this fact which he never attempted to discharge.\\nIt is impossible therefore to accept this contention on behalf of the appellant raised for the first time before us in the course of the submissions made on behalf of the appellant.\\nRegarding the second point arising out of the definition of 'Mahal ', the High Court definitely found that the petitioner had given no evidence to establish that the villages in question were not assessed to land revenue.\\nOn the contrary, at least with reference to the Bhandar villages documents on the record showed that these villages had been assessed to land revenue.\\nSince it was a question of fact whether the villages had been assessed to land revenue, which was denied on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh, the High Court rightly held that the contention of the appellant in this respect could not be accepted.\\nAs for the other villages, in Schedules A and B of the petition of the appellant under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution the High Court, in our opinion, rightly held that the petition was not maintainable as these villages had not yet been recognised by the Government of India as the private property of the appellant.\\nIn our opinion, the appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed with costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n\",\n          \"iminal Appeal No. 40 of 1951, 127 Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated the 1st June, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature in Assam (Thadani C.J. and Ram Labhaya J.,) in Criminal Reference No. I of 1951, arising out of Judgment and Order dated the 15th November, 1950, of the Court of the Additional District Magistrate, Lakhimpur, in Case No. 1126C of 1950.\\nJindra Lal for the appellant.\\nNuruddin Ahmed for the respondent.\\nOctober 23.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.\\nRameshwar Bhartia, the appellant, is a shopkeeper in Assam.\\nHe was prosecuted for storing paddy without a licence in excess of the quantity permitted by the Assam Food Grains Control Order, 1947.\\nHe admitted storage and possession of 550 maunds of paddy, but pleaded that he did not know that any licence was necessary.\\nThe 'Additional District Magistrate recorded a plea of guilty, but imposed him a fine of Rs. 50 only, as he considered his ignorance of the provisions of the Food Grains Control Order to be genuine.\\nThe stock of paddy was left in the possession of the appellant by the Procurement Inspector under a Jimmanama or security bond executed in his favour.\\nHe was subsequently unable to produce it before the court, as the whole of it was taken away by a Congress M.L.A. for affording relief to those who suffered in the earthquake, and so, the appellant was ordered to procure a similar quantity of paddy after taking an appropriate licence, and to make over the same to the procurement department payment of the price.\\nThe District Magistrate, being moved to do so by the procurement department, referred the case to the High Court under section 438, Criminal Procedure Code, for enhancement of the sentence, as in his opinion the sentence was unduly lenient and the Jimmanama, which was admittedly broken, should have been forfeited.\\n128 The reference was accepted by the High Court, and the sent ence was enhanced to rigorous ' imprisonment for six months and a fine of Rs. 1,000.\\nAs regards the Jimmanama, the case was sent back to the trial court for taking action according to law under section 514, Criminal Procedure Code, for its forfeiture.\\nThe appellant applied to the High.\\nCourt for a certificate under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution that the case was a fit one for appeal to this Court.\\nThis application was granted.\\nOut of the three points urged for the appellant, two were rejected, but the third one was accepted as a good ground, namely, that there was a contravention of the provisions of section 556, Criminal Procedure Code and that consequently the, trial before the Additional District Magistrate was void.\\nOne of the contentions urged before us was that Shri C.K. Bhuyan was not a \\\"Director\\\" at all and therefore there was no valid sanction under section 38 of the Order.\\nA notifications dated 16th May) 1950, and published in the Assam Gazette of the 24th May, 1950, was produced before us to show that Sri C.K. Bhuyan was an Additional Deputy Commissioner and it was conceded by the appellant 's counsel before the High Court that if he was a Deputy Commissioner, he would be a Director under the Order, as all Deputy Commissioners in Assam were notified as Directors for the purposes of the Order.\\nMr. Jindra Lal sought to draw a distinction between a Deputy Commissioner and an Additional Deputy Commissioner in this respect, but there is no warrant for the same,, apart from the circumstance that it is a question of fact which has to be investigated afresh, and which we cannot allow to be raised now for the first time.\\nThe primary question to consider in this appeal is whether there has been any infringement of Section 556, Criminal Procedure Code, and a consequent want of jurisdiction in the court which tried the offence.\\nThe facts relevant to this question lie 129 within a narrow compass.\\nThe Procurement Inspector sent a report , Ist July,1950 about the nature of the offence ; he wrote out a short note the, subject, and requested that the accused might be prosecuted and the Assistant Director of Procurement, Dibru garh, might be authorised to dispose of the paddy immediately to avoid loss due to deterioration, Sri 0.\\nK. Bhuyan,who was the then District Magistrate Lakhimpur, made the following order: \\\"Prosecution sanctioned under section 7 (1) of ,the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, for violation of sections 3 and 7 of the Assam Food Grains Oontrol Order, 1947.\\n\\\" The case happened to be tried by the same gentleman in his capacity as Addtional District Magistrate, and the accused was convicted as aforesaid.\\nThe argument for the appellant was that having sanctioned the prosecution, Sri C.K. Bhuyan became \\\"personally interested\\\" in the case within the meaning of section 556, and was therefore incompetent to try the same.\\nIt was contended that the trial was not only irregular but illegal.\\nThere is no question that \\\"personal interest\\\" within the meaning of the section is not limited to private interest, and that it may well include official interest also.\\nBut what is the extent of the interest which will attract the disability is a subject which different views are possible and have been taken.\\nSection 556 itself indicates the difficulty.\\nThe Explanation to the section runs in these terms: \\\"A Judge or Magistrate shall not be deemed a party, or personally interested, within the , meaning of this section, to or in any case by reason only that be is a Municipal Commissioner or otherwise concerned therein in a public capacity, or by reason only that he has viewed the place in which an offence, is alleged to have been committed, or any other place .in which any other transaction material to the case 'is alleged to have occurred, and made an inquiry III connection with the case.\\n\\\" 130 This shows that to be connected with a case in a public capacity is not by itself enough to render the person incompetent to try it.\\nEven if he had made an enquiry in connection with this case, it would not matter.\\nBut look at the illustration: \\\"A, as collector, upon consideration of information furnished to him, directs the prosecution of B for a breach of the excise laws.\\nA is disqualified from trying this case as a Magistrate.\\n\\\" It is evident from the words of the illustration that if a prosecution is directed by a person in one capacity, he shall not try the case acting in another capacity as a Magistrate.\\nThe explanation and illustration lend some support to the view that there is a distinction between a passive interest and an active interest, and that it is only in the latter case that the disqualification arises or intervenes.\\nUnder sub section (3) (a) of section 2 of the Assam Food Grains Control Order \\\"Director\\\" means \\\"the Director of Supply, Assam, and includes, for the purpose of any specific. provision of this Order, any other officer duly authorised in that behalf by him or by the Provincial Government by notification in the Official Gazette.\\n\\\" Section 38 provides: No prosecution in respect of an alleged contravention of any provision of this Order shall be instituted without the sanction of the Director.\\n\\\" A little confusion is likely to arise from the employment of the word \\\" Director\\\" in the Control Order and the word \\\"directs\\\" in the illustration to section 556 of the Code '.\\nIt has to be borne in mind that a sanction by the Director within the meaning of the Code does not necessarily mean \\\"a direction given by him that the accused should be prosecuted.\\n\\\" In both cases of sanction and direction, an application of the mind is necessary, but there is this essential difference that in the one case there is a legal impediment to the prosecution if there be no sanction, and in the other case, there is a positive order that 131 the prosecution should be launched.\\nFor a sanction, all that is necessary for one to be satisfied about is the existence of a prima facie case.\\nIn the case of a, direction, a further element that the accused deserves to be prosecuted is involved.\\nThe question whether a Magistrate is personally interested or not has essentially to be decided the facts in each case.\\nPecuniary interest, however small, will be a disqualification but as regards other kinds of interest, there is no measure or standard except that it should be a substantial one, giving rise to a real bias, or a reasonable apprehension the part of the accused of such bias.\\n, The maxim \\\" Nemo debet esse judex in propria sua causa\\\" applies only when the interest attributed is such as to render the case his own cause.\\nThe fulfllment of a technical requirement imposed by a statute may not, in many cases, amount to a mental satisfaction of the truth of the facts placed before the officer.\\nWhether sanction should be granted or not may conceivably depend upon consideration extraneous to the merits of the case.\\nBut where a prosecution is directed, it means that the authority who gives the direction is satisfied in his own mind that the case must be initiated.\\nSanction is in the nature of a permission while a direction is in the nature of a command.\\nLet us now examine some of the decisions the subject.\\nFor the appellant, strong reliance was placed the judgment of the Privy Council in Gokulchand Dwarkadas vs King(1), and it was argued the basis of some of the observations of the Judicial Committee that a sanction was an important and substantial matter and not a mere formality.\\nThe facts in that case were that while there was a sanction of the Government for a prosecution under the Cotton Cloth and Yarn Control, Order, there was nothing in the sanction itself, or in the shape of extraneous evidence, to show that the sanction was accorded after the relevant facts were placed before the sanctioning authority.\\nTo quote their Lordships ' own words; (1) (1948) 52 C.W.N.325.\\n132 \\\"There is no evidence to show that the report of the Sub Inspector to the District Superintendent of Police, which was not put in evidence, was forwarded to the District Magistrate, nor is there any evidence is to the contents of the endorsement of the District Magistrate, referred to in the sanction, which endorsement also was not put in evidence.\\nThe prosecution was in a position either to produce or to account for the absence of the 'report made to the District Superintendent of Police and the endorsement of the District Magistrate referred to in the sanction, and to call any necessary oral evidence to supplement the documents and show what were the facts which the sanction was given.\\n\\\" It is in this connection that their Lordships em phasise that the sanction to prosecute is an important step constituting a condition precedent, and observe: \\\"Looked at as a matter of substance it is plain that the Government cannot adequately discharge the obligation of deciding whether to give or withhold a sanction without a knowledge of the facts of the case.\\nNor, in their Lordships ' view, is a sanction given without reference to the facts constituting the offence a compliance with the actual terms of clause 23.\\n\\\" This, however, is no authority for the position that a sanction stands the same footing as a direction.\\nIt is true that the facts should be known to the sanctioning authority ; but it is not at all necessary that the authority should embark also an investigation of the facts, deep or perfunctory, before according the sanction.\\nThe decision lends no support to the view that wherever there is a sanction, the sanctioning authority is disabled under section 556 of the Code from trying the case initiated as a result of the sanction. the other hand, there is plenty of support for the opposite) view.\\nIn the very early case of The Government of Bengal vs HeeraLall Dass and Others(1), at a time when there (1) (1872) 17 Weekly Reporter, Criminal Rulings, 39. 133 was no such statutory provision as section 556 of the Code but, only the general rule of law that a man could not be judge in a case in which he had an interest, the facts were that a Sub Registrar, who was also an Assistant Magistrate, having come to know in his official capacity as a registering officer that an offence under the Registration Act had been committed, sanctioned a prosecution, and subsequently tried the case himself.\\nA Full Bench consisting of Sir Richard Couch C. ' J. and five other learned Judges came to the conclusion, after an examination of some of the English cases, that the trial was not vitiated.\\nThe learned Chief Justice said: \\\"In this case, I think, the Sub Registrar has not such an interest in the matter as disqualifies him from trying the case; and I may observe with reference to some of the arguments that have been used as to the Sub Registrar having made up his mind, and that the accused would have no chance of a fair trial, that the sanction of the superior officer, the Registrar, is required before the prosecution can be instituted, and certainly I do not consider that the prosecution will not be instituted unless the Sub Registrar has made up his mind as to the guilt of the party.\\nIt is his duty, when he comes to know that an offence has been committed, to cause a prosecution to be instituted, by which I understand that there is prima facie evidence of an offence having been committed, that there is that which renders it proper that there should be ail enquiry, and the Registrar accordingly gives his sanction to it ; and certainly, I cannot suppose that, because an officer in his position sanctions the institution of a prosecution, his mind is made up as to the guilt of the party and .\\nthat he is not willing to consider the evidence which may be produced before him when he comes to try the case.\\nIn this case, there appears to 'be no such interest as would prevent the case from going\\\" before the Magistrate as the trying authority . 134 In Queen Empress vs Chenchi Reddi(1) it was pointed out that when there was only an authorisation and not a direction, there was no supervening disability ; and the case of Girish Chunder Ghose vs The QueenEmpress(2) was distinguished, the ground that there the Magistrate had taken a very active part in connection with the case as an executive officer.\\nThe Bombay High Court went even a step further in the case reported in Emperor vs Bavji(3), where the Magistrate who tried the case had earlier held a departmental enquiry and forwarded the papers to the Collector with his opinion that there was sufficient evidence to justify a criminal prosecution.\\nAs he did no more than express an opinion that there was evidence, which he, had neither taken nor sifted, which made a criminal prosecution desirable, it was held that the Magistrate was not disqualified from holding the trial, though, no doubt it would have been more expedient had the Collector sent the case for disposal to another of his subordinates.\\nAs stated already, the question whether the bar under section 556 comes into play depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, the dividing line being a thin one somewhat but still sufficiently definite and tangible, namely, the removal of a legal impediment by the grant 'of sanction and the initiation of criminal proceedings as the result of a direction.\\nIn the present case before us, we have nothing more than a sanction, and consequently we are unable to hold that the trial has become vitiated by reason of the provisions of section 556, Criminal Procedure Code.\\nThe other point taken behalf of the appellant is a more substantial one.\\nThe security bond was taken from him not by the court but by the Procurement Inspector.\\nIt is true that it contained the undertaking that, the seized paddy would be produced before the court, but still it was a promise made to the particular official and not to the court.\\nThe High (1) Mad. 238.\\n(3) (19O3) (2) Cal.\\n857. 135 Court was in error in thinking that section 514, Criminal Procedure Code, applied.\\nAction could be taken only when the bond is taken by the court under the provisions of the Code such as section 91 for appearance, the several security sections or those relating to bail.\\nClause (1) of section 514 runs: \\\"Whenever it is proved to the satisfaction of the, Court by which a bond under this Code has been taken, or of the Court of a Presidency Magistrate or Magistrate of the first class, or when the bond is for appearance before a Court, to the satisfaction of such Court, that such bond has been forfeited, the Court shall record the grounds of such proof, and may call upon any person bound by such bond to pay the penalty thereof, or to show cause why it should not be paid.\\n\\\" The language is perfectly clear; the power to forfeit and the imposition of the penalty provided for in the later parts of the section arise only if the preliminary conditions are satisfied.\\nThere was no argument addressed to us that the High Court in suggesting that action should be taken under section 514 for forfeiture of the bond acted in the exercise of its inherent powers under section 561 A.\\nIt did not purport to exercise any such power; and, moreover, there will then arise the question whether when the Code contains an express provision a particular subject, there could be any resort to inherent jurisdiction, under a general provision.\\nWe have got an additional circumstance in the appellant 's favour in this case that the seized paddy was taken away by a member of the Legislative Assembly for giving relief to those affected by the earthquake, and if that is true, as it seems to be from the letter written by the ' M.L.A. to the Additional District Magistrate the 1st November, 1950, it appears to us harsh, if not unjust, to ask him to produce the same paddy or a similar quantity of paddy.\\nThe order of the High Court sending back the case to the 136 Magistrate for taking action according to law under section 514 will, therefore, stand set aside.\\nWe generally do not interfere in the matter of sentence, but in this case we find that the Magistrate has held that the appellant 's plea that he was ignorant of the provisions of the Assam Food Grains Control Order, 1947, was a genuine one.\\nHaving regard to this circumstance and the fact that from a fine of Rs. 50 to 6 months ' rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000 is a big jump, we think it is appropriate that the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the High Court should be set aside and we order accordingly.\\nThe fine of Rs. 1,000 will stand.\\nSentence reduced.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"dataset_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"IN-Abs\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"An agreement for a lease, which a lease is by the Indian declared to include, must be a document which effects an actual demise and operates as a lease.\\nIt must create present and immediate interest in land.\\nWhere a litigation between two persons A and B who claimed to be tenants under C was settled by a compromise decree the effect of which was to create a perpetual underlease between A and B which was to take effect only on condition that A paid Rs. 8,000 to C within a fixed period: Held, that such a contingent agreement was not \\\"a lease\\\" within el.\\n(a) of section 17 (t) of the Indian , and even though it was covered by cl.\\n(b) of the said sec tion it was exempt from registration under el.\\n(vi) of subs.\\n(2) of section 17.\\nHemanta Kumari Debi vs Midnapur Zamindari Co.

appellant guaranteed article 3 merger agreement. seems clear us, however, view provisions article 363(1) constitution dispute arising merger agreement instrument accession beyond competence courts enquire into. high court rightly decided point appellant. reference first point would first consider whether appellant ex ruler purposes act. factually cannot denied, since ceded state government

state agreed administration state would transferred government india january 1, 1948. question whether recognition purposes constitution ruler virtue provisions article 366(22) constitution india

appears us clear. ordinary dictionary meaning maufi \\\"released, exempted, exempt payment rent tax, rent free\\\" maufidar \\\"a holder rent free land, grantee\\\". common ground high court villages
